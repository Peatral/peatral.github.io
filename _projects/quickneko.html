<p class="justify">This is a silly chrome extension I made in an evening and an afternoon.
    It fetches random images from nekos.life and displays them in a browser action. 
    You can click the image to go to the next, select different categories, 
    switch between sfw and nsfw and toggle a slideshow that changes every ~5 seconds to a new image.
