<p class="justify">
  This is a silly chrome extension I made in an evening and an afternoon. It
  fetches random images from nekos.life and displays them in a browser action.
  You can click the image to go to the next, select different categories, switch
  between sfw and nsfw and toggle a slideshow that changes every ~5 seconds to a
  new image.
