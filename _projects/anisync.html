<p class="justify">I used MAL before but then a friend came to me and said: "AniList is much better!". I looked and it and answered: 
    "Yup, that's right. But I still will use MAL because I can sync my progress directly with my profile through the application I use to watch my stuff. 
    But I don't want to manually sync those profiles. Ok, I just make an app for it."
    So time passed and I progressed further and further but because I don't want anyone to die from my app there is no release till now. 
    But to "enjoy" it, you can just compile it yourself via Android Studio.
