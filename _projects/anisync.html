  I used MAL before but then a friend came to me and said: "AniList is much
  better!". I looked and it and answered: "Yup, that's right. But I still will
  use MAL because I can sync my progress directly with my profile through the
  application I use to watch my stuff. But I don't want to manually sync those
  profiles. Ok, I just make an app for it." So time passed and I progressed
  further and further but because I don't want anyone to die from my app there
  is no release till now. But to "enjoy" it, you can just compile it yourself
  via Android Studio.
