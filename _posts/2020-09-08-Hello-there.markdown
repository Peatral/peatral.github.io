I don't know how you found this page, but you found it. Congratulations!

On my original site, the first post was something along the lines of "I'm glad that I have a page now" and "I will make something big and revolutionary". This definitely didn't happen, although I posted several things back then. And there is the problem: several things over the course of two years is nothing talking in the blogging context. I practically didn't use the site.
Two years later I had to do some presentations in school, and remembering reveal.js, a html based presentation framework which my computer science teacher introduced me to, I fiddled around and came to the conclusion that I could actually host them online via GitHub Pages. A quite elegant solution for people like me that have zero budget. And having actual knowledge about html and a bit of css I thought: "Why don't I make a good looking homepage for myself with my design, not strictly following a template from wordpress and such." I updated it regularily and with the time I gathered quite an amount of presentations. While I was manually keeping track and adding links to them I added a projects section to the frontpage (between all the lorem ipsum). And after copy-pasting cards around, I once said to myself: "Now I will do it right!" and build the page new from ground up. Now it is way easier for me to handle things, add new projects, posts and presentations. And also it looks a whole lot nicer...
